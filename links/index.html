<p><a href="http://idealistmag.com/sleep/6am/" target="_blank">6am</a>
(<a href="https://twitter.com/rivatez" target="_blank">Riva-Melissa Tez</a>)
- A reflection on how much there is to marvel at and learn about and do.  Big mood.<br />
&ldquo;It’s a weird paradox to be so in awe with life that it leaves you detached from important sleep. To be in awe. That’s what the days are for.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1088347054974201858" target="_blank">Dumb Tweeting/Smart Writing</a>
(<a href="https://twitter.com/visakanv" target="_blank">Visakan Veerasamy</a>)
- A thread on writing, taste, and being yourself (one of Visa&rsquo;s many many threads).  He also writes about navigating life, thinking, EQ, improving, infinite games, and more. Including dumb tweets.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/TheAnnaGat/status/1137403902561857536" target="_blank">&ldquo;Why Is It Interesting?&rdquo; - War Strategy</a>
(<a href="https://twitter.com/TheAnnaGat" target="_blank">Anna Gát</a>)
- A video of Anna examining war as a study of systems, psychology, decision-making, and communication.<br />
One of my favourite takes here: vacation as war.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.perell.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-writing-online" target="_blank">The Ultimate Guide to Writing Online</a>
(<a href="https://twitter.com/david_perell" target="_blank">David Perell</a>)
- One of the inspirations for getting this site up and running.  David describes the benefits of online writing, distribution, and scale (and how to get started).<br />
&ldquo;Like any smart investment, [writing] builds on itself. Write something once and you can share it for the rest of your life.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/" target="_blank">Salary Negotiation</a>
(<a href="https://twitter.com/patio11" target="_blank">Patrick McKenzie</a>)
- At the root, I think this piece is about understanding how to perceive your professional value, and how companies perceive it.  Also why salary negotiation matters and how to approach it.</p>

<p><a href="https://everythingstudies.com/2018/04/26/a-deep-dive-into-the-harris-klein-controversy/" target="_blank">A Deep Dive into the Harris-Klein Controversy</a>
(<a href="https://twitter.com/everytstudies" target="_blank">John Nerst</a>)
- An analysis of when two parties struggle to discuss and debate because they&rsquo;re playing by two different sets of rules (scientific and political).
It becomes a meta-argument about these two paradigms without the parties realizing.  Or resolving the discussion.<br />
How can we learn and do better?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/3-tips-hire-culture-fit-jennifer-kim/?published=t" target="_blank">How to actually hire for &ldquo;Culture Fit&rdquo;, without resorting to unfair biases</a>
(<a href="https://twitter.com/jenistyping" target="_blank">Jennifer Kim</a>)
- Three tips on building a company with the culture you want.<br />
I&rsquo;m especially a fan of Tip 3 &mdash; marketing your company culture well attracts strong candidates for you (similar to David Perrell&rsquo;s post on writing as an autonomous asset).</p>
