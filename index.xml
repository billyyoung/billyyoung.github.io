      <description>In the span of two weeks, 3 friends asked me for Tokyo recommendations from my trip earlier this year. So I&amp;rsquo;m putting those recommendations here as a sort of log / for future reference.
Here are some general tips on how to travel to Tokyo. The rest is all about food, coffeeshops, and games (the majority of time spent during my recent trip).
Inspired by my friends&amp;rsquo; recs (thanks Ophelia), The Cup and the Road blog, and the random Swiss guy who told me about Kanemasu over tempura.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always been fascinated by how great writers can break apart complex systems, stir up emotions, and build worlds. Writing is an especially important skill now, as we live and breathe email, iMessage, and Slack. Where you can find friends, and even a tribe, solely via Twitter.
As with anything I find interesting, I wanted to try doing it myself. With writing, though, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure where or how to start.</description>

      <description>I like reading things that bring joy to myself and others, or teach me how to better do so. Here are some of those things.
Also consider following all of these awesome people on Twitter!
6am (Riva-Melissa Tez) &amp;mdash; A reflection on how much there is to marvel at and learn about and do. Big mood.
&amp;ldquo;Itâ€™s a weird paradox to be so in awe with life that it leaves you detached from important sleep.</description>

      <description>Thanks for visiting my fledgeling corner of the Internet.
My motivations, in the simplest terms: become the best version of myself I can be, bring joy to others, and bring joy to myself.
Here you&amp;rsquo;ll find posts about: thinking, learning, music, education, personality, and tech.
