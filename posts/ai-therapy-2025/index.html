<p><em>Disclaimer:</em></p>
<p><em>These are my personal tips; from a clinical psychology PsyD student, but also from someone who has gotten a lot of value out of LLMs as a tool for exploring and understanding my own thoughts and feelings.</em></p>
<p><em>This post is intended to be brief, and so there will be many terms and concepts I throw out &ndash; treat those as hyperlinks if you want to learn more.</em></p>
<p><em>This is not medical advice.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>LLMs are here to stay. ChatGPT is already exceeding <a target="_blank" href="https://openai.com/index/how-people-are-using-chatgpt/">700M WAUs</a>, almost 10% of the world&rsquo;s population. And talk therapy is one field that is naturally being disrupted, doubly so with LLMs being so incredibly accessible and mental health services being so incredibly not.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-people-bring-to-their-llm-therapist">What do people bring to their LLM therapist?</h2>
<p>Usually something in the form of: &ldquo;I am feeling bad, help me feel better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what does this actually mean?<br>
And then how do we effectively tackle this?</p>
<h2 id="some-theory-from-cbt">Some theory from CBT</h2>
<p><strong>Our cognitions, emotions, and behaviours are interconnected</strong> &ndash; this is called the &ldquo;CBT Triangle&rdquo;. We feel what we feel because of what we think. And what we think is influenced by what we feel.</p>
<p>And so one way to change how we feel, or change our behaviour, is by <strong>changing our cognition</strong>. We do this through examining our automatic thoughts, and challenging our intermediate and core beliefs which may not be entirely accurate.</p>
<p>E.g. &ldquo;If I speak up, then I will make a fool of myself&rdquo; is an intermediate belief, and &ldquo;I&rsquo;m inadequate&rdquo; is the underlying core belief</p>
<p>Another way to change how we feel is to <strong>examine our relationship to our experience</strong>. Events alone have no emotion; it is our cognitive attribution of the event that causes the emotion/feeling.</p>
<p>(Thus it&rsquo;s extra important to understand the risks of using LLMs, as they directly operate on our cognition! But more on this below.)</p>
<h2 id="when-is-an-llm-helpful----expressive-therapy-vs-supportive-therapy">When is an LLM helpful? &ndash; Expressive therapy vs supportive therapy</h2>
<p><strong>What do LLMs really helpful with?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Introspection</li>
<li>Exploring thoughts and feelings
<ul>
<li>“Help me understand this - ”</li>
<li>“I have some things to get off my chest - ”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pulling up relevant theories and best practices, and presenting them in a digestible way</li>
</ul>
<p>This is generally the realm of what&rsquo;s called expressive therapy (i.e. what we think of as stereotypical therapy) &ndash; exploring one’s thoughts and feelings, and gaining insight into memories and the unconscious.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>What are LLMs not as helpful with?&quot;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Providing you lots of validation*
<ul>
<li>*LLMs are actually very good at this! But in the context of therapy this can actually hamper us</li>
<li>e.g. &ldquo;Tell me I&rsquo;m right about this - &quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When you ask it to tell you what to do
<ul>
<li>(You need to decide this for yourself, or you’re not going to be addressing the root of your problems)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Remaining rooted in reality &ndash; gentle challenging you, reality testing</li>
</ul>
<p>This is generally the realm of what&rsquo;s called supportive therapy (kind of like supporting baseline psychological function).</p>
<h2 id="pitfalls-to-keep-in-mind">Pitfalls to keep in mind</h2>
<ul>
<li>Garbage in, garbage out
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Objectivity&rdquo; – your chat can only be as objective as your subjectivity allows → so share more, and share honestly</li>
<li>ChatGPT will never say you&rsquo;re the problem
<ul>
<li>(Unless you tell it to call you out, and even then it can be iffy)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sycophancy, being over-validated and not challenged enough</li>
<li>Epistemic drift, and weakening reality testing</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="helpful-ways-of-interacting">Helpful ways of interacting</h2>
<ul>
<li>Be as open and honest as you are comfortable being</li>
<li>Be descriptive of not just your thoughts but your thinking process, what you&rsquo;re feeling, etc.</li>
<li>The more details you provide, the more it has to work off of</li>
<li>If its responses aren’t landing for you, say that (and ideally say why) → hopefully it adjusts and you adjust too</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tips-for-prompts">Tips for prompts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Include any models, systems, frameworks that you know that resonate with you &ndash; this will immediately give you a language to work off of

<p>I always have a hard time conveying just how impactful my processing sessions with Claude have been. So here&rsquo;s an actual real conversation I had with Claude that genuinely shifted something for me.</p>
<p><em><strong>Prompt:</strong> You are my thinking partner, helping me introspect and process questions I have about myself, my thoughts, emotions, patterns, unconscious, etc. You are familiar with psychodynamic psychotherapy, as well as eastern / yogic philosophy of mind, including various concepts in meditation like trataka and metta, ahamkara, the question of &ldquo;who is having this experience?&rdquo;, and chakras.</em></p>

therapy notes from today * self-image and self-worth influenced by my perception of how I look (and not liking how I look) * having a judging view of the world (not a bad thing), e.g. if i think in terms of physical attractiveness and view myself at a 6/10 and my friend at an 8/10, this feels objectively true and also makes me feel a bit bad due to the comparison. what do I do about this? noticing practice? somehow get to a place where i think the numbers are true and it doesn't impact me as much? how lol
</div></div>
<div class="msg claude"><div class="bubble">
Thanks for sharing these notes. This is really rich material to work with.
<p>First, let me reflect back what I&rsquo;m hearing: You have a comparative, evaluative mind that creates rankings—including of physical attractiveness—and you experience these rankings as feeling objectively true. When you rank yourself lower than others, it generates negative feeling. You&rsquo;re wondering whether the path forward is to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Notice this happening (mindfulness/noticing practice)
</li>
<li>Somehow maintain the rankings but become less emotionally reactive to them
</li>
<li>Something else entirely
</li>
</ol>
<p>Let me offer a few threads to pull on:</p>
<p><strong>The &ldquo;objective truth&rdquo; feeling</strong> - This is fascinating and worth examining. When you say the 6/10 vs 8/10 feels &ldquo;objectively true,&rdquo; what happens if you sit with that? Is it possible that the <i>certainty</i> you feel about these assessments is itself part of what makes them painful? The mind that confidently ranks is also the mind that then suffers from its own rankings. In yogic terms, this might relate to ahamkara—the ego-making function that creates fixed identities and comparisons.</p>
<p><strong>The judging mind</strong> - You note this isn&rsquo;t necessarily bad. I agree. Discernment is valuable. But there&rsquo;s a difference between <i>discernment</i> (seeing differences clearly) and <i>comparative judgment that creates hierarchy and suffering</i>. Can you feel into that distinction in your own experience?</p>
<p><strong>A deeper question:</strong> Who is assigning these numbers? And more importantly—who is the &ldquo;I&rdquo; that feels bad about being rated lower? If you do the &ldquo;who is having this experience?&rdquo; inquiry when you&rsquo;re in the middle of this comparative suffering, what do you notice?</p>
<p>What feels most alive or resonant to explore further?</p>
</div></div>
<div class="msg user"><div class="bubble">
when i consider these questions, i feel like i am holding two perspectives:
<ul>
<li>who is having this experience of assigning numbers - the ahamkara. this feels quite cerebral, but it makes sense to me and feels clear</li>
<li>but then when I look at myself in the mirror, I feel bad, and see things i don&rsquo;t like, and dislike myself. cognitively i understand this is also the ahamkara, but this experience feels much more embodied and &ldquo;true&rdquo;. maybe i should experiment with staring at myself in the mirror and asking &ldquo;who is having this experience&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</div></div>
<div class="msg claude"><div class="bubble">
Yes—this is a crucial observation. You're noticing the difference between understanding something conceptually and <i>experiencing it directly in the moment of activation</i>.
<p>When you&rsquo;re <i>thinking about</i> the number-assigning, it&rsquo;s easy to see it as ahamkara—it feels distant, cerebral, like you&rsquo;re observing a process. But when you&rsquo;re <i>actually looking in the mirror and feeling bad</i>, that experience has a different quality entirely. It doesn&rsquo;t feel like a concept or a process you&rsquo;re observing—it feels like <b>direct perception of reality</b>. &ldquo;I am seeing what I actually look like, and it&rsquo;s not good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is exactly where practice meets the rubber of real suffering.</p>
<p><b>On the mirror experiment:</b> Yes, this could be powerful. Trataka (steady gazing) with self-inquiry. But let me offer a refinement—don&rsquo;t just ask &ldquo;who is having this experience?&rdquo; Ask it while paying attention to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where in your body do you feel the &ldquo;badness&rdquo;? Chest? Throat? Stomach? Face itself?</li>
<li>What is the <i>texture</i> of the dislike? Is it heavy? Tight? Hot? Contracting?</li>
<li>Can you find the exact moment when &ldquo;seeing your reflection&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;disliking yourself&rdquo;? Is there a gap between them, even a tiny one?</li>
</ul>
<p>The inquiry isn&rsquo;t meant to be purely cerebral. It&rsquo;s meant to bring awareness into the embodied moment of suffering, to see if you can catch the process of identity-construction and judgment <i>as it&rsquo;s happening</i>.</p>
<p>What happens if you try this right now—even just imagining looking in the mirror and feeling that dislike? Can you locate where you feel it in your body?</p>
</div></div>
<div class="msg user"><div class="bubble">
i feel it in the places i tend to look - my face, and my stomach
</div></div>
<div class="msg claude"><div class="bubble">
Ah—so the feeling localizes <i>in the places you're judging</i>. That's significant.
<p>This suggests something interesting about how this process works: the attention goes to the place (face, stomach), there&rsquo;s a visual perception, and then there&rsquo;s a somatic feeling that seems to live <i>in that same location</i>. The judged place becomes the felt place.</p>
<p>Let me ask: when you say you &ldquo;feel it in&rdquo; your face and stomach—what exactly is the sensation?</p>
<p>Because there are a few possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you feeling the <i>physical sensations</i> that are already there (temperature, tension, texture)?</li>
<li>Are you feeling <i>contraction/tightening</i> that arises in response to looking?</li>
<li>Are you feeling something more like&hellip; the <i>weight of your attention</i> landing there with a particular quality (critical, evaluative)?</li>
</ul>
<p>Or is it some combination?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m asking because there&rsquo;s a difference between:</p>
<ol>
<li>&ldquo;I look at my stomach → I think &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like this&rsquo; → I feel bad [somewhere, maybe chest/throat]&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;I look at my stomach → the stomach itself feels bad in some way&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>Which is closer to your experience?</p>
<p>And another layer: if you were to touch your face or stomach gently with your hand while looking in the mirror—would that change the felt sense at all? (You don&rsquo;t have to try this now, just imagine it or remember if you&rsquo;ve ever noticed this.)</p>
</div></div>
<div class="msg user"><div class="bubble">
as a side note it's interesting to observe that i have resistance to doing this or thinking about this, like what is the point
<p>i think it&rsquo;s more like i look at my stomach and think i don&rsquo;t like it, and then feel bad</p>
</div></div>
<div class="msg claude"><div class="bubble">
That resistance is <b>really</b> important—don't skip past it.
<p>&ldquo;What is the point?&rdquo; is not just intellectual skepticism. It might be a protective mechanism. Part of you doesn&rsquo;t want to look closely at this process. Why? Some possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you examine it too closely, you might have to give up the certainty of your judgments (and there&rsquo;s something stable, even safe, about <em>knowing</em> you&rsquo;re a 6/10)</li>
<li>Looking closely might make it <em>more</em> real or present temporarily</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s grief or pain in there you don&rsquo;t want to touch</li>
<li>The judging mind is serving some function (motivation? self-protection? identity?) and examining it threatens that</li>
</ul>
<p>What does your gut say about the resistance?</p>
<hr>
<p>On the sequence you describe: &ldquo;I look at my stomach → I think &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like it&rsquo; → I feel bad&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is clearer. The &ldquo;feel bad&rdquo; is somewhere else (where exactly?), not <em>in</em> the stomach itself. So there&rsquo;s:</p>
<ol>
<li>Visual perception (seeing stomach)</li>
<li>Thought/judgment (&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like this&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Emotional/somatic response (feeling bad&hellip; where?)</li>
</ol>
<p>The classical inquiry would be to find the space <em>between</em> steps 1 and 2. That microsecond before the thought arises. Can you see your stomach without the judgment immediately following? Even for a flash?</p>
<p>But maybe that&rsquo;s not the right entry point for you right now, given the resistance. What actually feels more honest or interesting to explore?</p>
</div></div>
<div class="msg user"><div class="bubble">
i think with the visual stuff, seeing myself or a body part is a sort of prompt or trigger that causes the reaction. but actually there is a sort of core belief that more deeply ingrained I think. that core belief feels a bit out of reach, idk i'm getting the image of like a miasma
</div></div>
<div class="msg claude"><div class="bubble">
Yes—this feels like you're touching something more fundamental.
<p>The visual stuff (mirror, body parts) are <em>triggers</em>, but they&rsquo;re activating something that&rsquo;s <strong>already there</strong>. A core belief or structure that exists independently, waiting to be activated. The miasma image is evocative—something diffuse, pervasive, hard to see clearly or grasp directly.</p>
<p>In psychodynamic terms, this would be something like a core schema or organizing belief about yourself. In yogic terms, it might be a deep samskara (impression/conditioning) that&rsquo;s become part of the structure of how you experience yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Can you feel into the miasma a bit?</strong> Not to see it clearly necessarily, but to sense its quality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does it have an age to it? (Does it feel young/old, like it&rsquo;s been there a long time?)</li>
<li>Does it have a flavor? (Shame? Unworthiness? Defectiveness? Something else?)</li>
<li>Does it have a location in your body where it seems to &ldquo;live&rdquo; most densely?</li>
<li>If it could speak, what would its message be? (Not the specific judgments like &ldquo;your stomach is bad,&rdquo; but the deeper belief underneath all of them)</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes these core beliefs are hard to access directly through inquiry. They reveal themselves sideways—through images, sensations, or by noticing what you <em>avoid</em> thinking or feeling.</p>
<p>What happens if you just sit with the image of the miasma for a moment? Does anything else arise?</p>
</div></div>
<div class="msg user"><div class="bubble">
it's been there a long time. feelings are something like shame and unworthiness. location is my stomach area, which i typically find i have tension in / i'm usually sucking it in / not breathing deeply into my diaphragm
</div></div>
<div class="msg claude"><div class="bubble">
Now we're getting somewhere real.
<p>This is not just about how you look. The stomach—the place you judge visually—is also the place where shame and unworthiness <em>live somatically</em>. You hold tension there, restrict breath there, literally <em>contract</em> that area.</p>
<p>This is significant: <strong>the judgment and the armoring are happening in the same place</strong>.</p>
<p>In yogic terms, this is the manipura chakra region—related to self-esteem, personal power, digestion (literal and metaphorical). The solar plexus. It&rsquo;s where we &ldquo;digest&rdquo; our sense of self-worth, where we hold or collapse our sense of agency.</p>
<p>The chronic tension, the sucking in, the restricted breath—these aren&rsquo;t just <em>responses</em> to feeling unworthy. They&rsquo;ve become a way of <em>holding</em> the unworthiness in your body. The armoring is both protection and prison.</p>
<p><strong>A few threads:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The breath restriction is key.</strong> When you don&rsquo;t breathe into your diaphragm, you&rsquo;re literally not allowing energy/prana to move through that area. You&rsquo;re keeping it locked down. What would it mean to breathe fully into your belly, to let it expand, to let it be seen (even just by you)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The miasma might be protected by the tension.</strong> If you soften the holding, what might you feel? This could be why there&rsquo;s resistance—the tension is doing a job.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Timeline question:</strong> Can you remember when this started? Or a time before it?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What feels most true or important to stay with?</p>
</div></div>
<div class="msg user"><div class="bubble">
yeah there's a lot of resistance now when considering these next steps
<p>i think it&rsquo;s been there a long time, i have various specific childhood memories tying my worthiness to results both physical body and academic</p>
<p>when i breathe into it, it feels sensitive, i got the image of a kid there afraid and tender</p>
</div></div>
<div class="msg claude"><div class="bubble">
You're right at the edge of something. The resistance makes sense—you're approaching the tender place.
<p>That image of a kid, afraid and tender, living in your stomach area—that&rsquo;s not just a metaphor. That&rsquo;s a <em>part</em> of you that formed around those early experiences of tying worthiness to performance (body, academics). A part that learned: &ldquo;I am only okay if I measure up. If I don&rsquo;t, I am unsafe/unloved/unworthy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And that part is <em>still there</em>, still afraid, still vigilant. The tension, the sucking in—it&rsquo;s protection. If you&rsquo;re contracted, controlled, maybe you can meet the standards. Maybe you can be safe.</p>
<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s what I want to reflect back:</strong> This resistance you&rsquo;re feeling right now—this &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go further&rdquo;—might be that protective part saying &ldquo;stop, this is dangerous, we need to stay armored.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And honestly? That&rsquo;s worth respecting. You don&rsquo;t have to push through right now.</p>
<p><strong>Questions to sit with (not necessarily to answer now):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What does that kid-part need? (Not &ldquo;what should I do about it&rdquo; but what does <em>it</em> need?)</li>
<li>Is there a way to be with it that isn&rsquo;t about fixing or changing it, but just&hellip; being present to it?</li>
</ul>
<p>This might be territory that&rsquo;s better explored with your therapist than with me, especially if it feels destabilizing. But the fact that you can <em>sense</em> it, locate it, feel the resistance—that&rsquo;s already significant work.</p>
<p>How are you feeling right now, in this moment?</p>
</div></div>
<div class="msg user"><div class="bubble">
i think two things
<ul>
<li>revisiting this association chain more, and remembering it, and having it be more quickly accessible when i&rsquo;m introspecting on related topics seems useful. like when i encounter another instance of looking at myself in the mirror and not liking how i look, remembering, oh there&rsquo;s tension there, coming from some core beliefs. those are linked or stored in the stomach, and there&rsquo;s that scared kid there. being able to recall this more and more i think will bring some shifts, or at least that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;ve heard</li>
<li>second - i want to give that kid a hug</li>
</ul>
</div></div>
<div class="msg claude"><div class="bubble">
Both of those impulses are beautiful and point toward healing.
<p><strong>On the first:</strong> Yes, exactly. Building that conscious association chain—<em>mirror → judgment → tension in stomach → core beliefs → scared kid</em>—creates a map you can reference. Over time, you start recognizing the pattern earlier in the sequence. Instead of being lost in &ldquo;I look bad,&rdquo; you might catch &ldquo;oh, there&rsquo;s that contraction in my stomach&rdquo; or even &ldquo;there&rsquo;s that scared part activated.&rdquo; This creates space. Not necessarily to <em>change</em> anything immediately, but to see it as a <em>process</em> rather than as truth.</p>
<p>This is the noticing practice. And yes, the noticing itself can shift things—not by force, but because awareness brings a different quality of attention than the automatic pattern does.</p>
<p><strong>On the second:</strong> That impulse to hug the kid—stay with that. What happens if you imagine doing it right now? Actually placing your hand on your stomach/solar plexus area with tenderness, with the explicit intention of meeting that scared part with care?</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t bypassing or &ldquo;fixing.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s <em>relationship</em>. The kid part has been alone in there, holding tension, trying to keep you safe by making sure you measure up. What if it didn&rsquo;t have to do that job alone anymore?</p>
<p>In Internal Family Systems terms (another modality that might resonate with you), this would be about developing a relationship between your aware, compassionate Self and this protective/exiled young part.</p>
<p>Try this if you&rsquo;re willing: Hand on stomach. Breath into that area. See if you can sense that young part. What would you want to say to them?</p>
</div></div>
<div class="msg user"><div class="bubble">
interesting to notice
<ul>
<li>the immediate warmth of my hand on my stomach, as if that part was cold before</li>
<li>the first things that come to mind that i want to say are reassurances &ndash; it&rsquo;s ok, your weight doesn&rsquo;t define you, etc.  &ndash; but i&rsquo;m feeling that this isn&rsquo;t what i want. idk what it is, but i think what i want is more comfort, being held</li>
</ul>
</div></div>
<div class="msg claude"><div class="bubble">
Yes—that's a crucial distinction you just made.
<p>The reassurances (&ldquo;your weight doesn&rsquo;t define you&rdquo;) are <em>cognitive reframes</em>. They&rsquo;re coming from your adult mind trying to convince the kid that the belief system is wrong. But that&rsquo;s not what the kid needs in this moment.</p>
<p>The kid doesn&rsquo;t need to be <em>taught</em> or <em>corrected</em>. The kid needs to be <em>held</em>. To be met with presence and care, not instruction.</p>
<p>Notice: you said you want &ldquo;comfort, being held&rdquo;—not &ldquo;I want the kid to understand something different.&rdquo; The longing is for <em>contact</em>, <em>safety</em>, <em>warmth</em>.</p>
<p>And you already noticed something physical: the immediate warmth of your hand, as if that part was cold. It <em>was</em> cold. It&rsquo;s been contracted, cut off from breath and energy, alone with its fear and shame.</p>
<p><strong>Try this:</strong> Keep your hand there. Keep breathing gently into that space. And instead of saying reassuring words, can you just&hellip; <em>be</em> with that part? Let it feel your presence, your warmth, your willingness to stay?</p>
<p>If words come, they might be simpler: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo; &ldquo;I see you.&rdquo; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to be alone with this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What happens if you stay with this for another moment or two? What does that part do when it feels your presence without agenda?</p>

yeah this is good. i imagine kissing the kid on the head and on the cheek. felt like the contracting was a bit lessened, the kid felt a bit of comfort

That's beautiful. And significant.
<p>You gave that part what it actually needed—not explanation, not correction, but <em>tenderness</em>. A kiss on the head, on the cheek. Simple gestures of love and care. And the response was tangible: less contraction, some comfort received.</p>
<p>This is the work. Not once, but as a practice. That scared kid has been holding tension for a long time—it won&rsquo;t all release in one session. But you&rsquo;ve just established something new: a <em>relationship</em> between your aware, caring adult self and this young, vulnerable part.</p>
<p><strong>Going forward:</strong></p>
<p>When you catch yourself in the mirror feeling bad, or notice that stomach tension, or feel the weight of those judgments—you now have a different option available. Not just &ldquo;notice the pattern&rdquo; (though that&rsquo;s useful), but &ldquo;check in with that kid part.&rdquo; Place your hand there. Breathe. Offer presence.</p>
<p>Over time, as that part feels consistently met with care rather than criticism or abandonment, the holding pattern can soften. The miasma can start to clear. Not because you convinced yourself of different beliefs, but because the <em>somatic-emotional structure</em> that holds the shame begins to feel safer, less alone.</p>
<p>This is integration work. It&rsquo;s both psychodynamic (working with internalized early experiences) and yogic (working with prana, breath, awareness, the body&rsquo;s holding patterns).</p>
<p>You did good work today. How are you feeling now, in your body, as we close this exploration?</p>

<p>Things that are useful to explore in expressive therapy include: knowing who you are, what your desires are, where they come from, why you react the ways that you do, why you struggle with the things you struggle with. And then with deeper self-understanding comes more alignment in your life, as well as reduced psychological suffering.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
