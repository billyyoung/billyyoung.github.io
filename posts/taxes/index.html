      <p>Here&rsquo;s a tip worth a thousand dollars: if you earned supplemental income in the US, then you may owe (a lot) more taxes on it than you think.</p>
<p>TL;DR: for high earners, especially those with stock grants in a public company, there&rsquo;s a difference between &ldquo;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/withholdingtax.asp">taxes withheld</a>&rdquo; and <strong>&ldquo;taxes owed&rdquo;</strong> on supplemental income, and you&rsquo;re responsible for paying that difference. This can be as high as an extra 15% in taxes (!), so consider setting funds aside ahead of time.</p>
<p>Note: I&rsquo;m going to use terms loosely and probably inaccurately. I&rsquo;m not a CPA. Consult a tax professional and all that for the most accurate assessment of your situation.</p>
<p>Time for a story.</p>
<p>Imagine you&rsquo;re a tech worker making <strong>$165,000/year</strong>. This puts you right about at the 32% tax bracket but you don&rsquo;t think about the details too much; you mainly just get reminded once a month that your rent eats up a lot more of your post-tax paycheck than you expected, but you still get to enjoy a nice omakase sushi meal with friends when you feel like it. You can&rsquo;t complain too much.</p>
<p>Even better, you&rsquo;re getting a year-end bonus of <strong>$50,000</strong>! But alas, the tax man strikes again and you end up with ~$30,000 in hand after taxes.  Still, not too shabby. You can get yourself that pair of shoes you&rsquo;ve been eyeing for several months (but only once they go on sale again, of course), and then invest the rest in a mix of tech stock picks on Robinhood that happen to all be companies your friends also work at, and crypto.</p>
<p>Fast forward to April next year and you&rsquo;re sitting at a coffee shop, in your new shoes, trying to get your taxes done. You finish filling everything in, and WHAT? TurboTax is saying you owe an <strong>additional $5,000 in taxes?</strong> That can&rsquo;t be right, because if it is it&rsquo;s going to all but deplete your cash savings.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<h2 id="number-crunching">Number-crunching</h2>
<p>Given your salary of <strong>$165,000</strong>, that indeed puts you at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/federal-income-tax-brackets">32% tax bracket</a>. Think of this as: any <strong>additional income</strong> you earn will be taxed at 32% or more for federal income tax.</p>
<p>When you receive your <strong>$50,000 bonus</strong>, you get $30,000 after <a target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/withholdingtax.asp">withholding</a>. This is where chaos and confusion come into play:</p>
<ul>
<li>~40% of your bonus is withheld immediately to pay taxes (22% federal + 10% state in CA + ~7.5% for Social Security, Medicare, etc.) = $20,000 withheld in total</li>
<li>But notice that federal withholding is only at 22% = <strong>$11,000 withheld</strong></li>
<li>Meanwhile you&rsquo;ll be held to 32% in federal income tax on your bonus = <strong>$16,000 owed</strong></li>
<li>So you&rsquo;ll owe an <strong>additional $5,000</strong> in taxes on top of the $11K withheld to meet the $16K</li>
</ul>
<p>Why are you withheld at 22% when you owe 32%? Who knows, but unfortunately that&rsquo;s just how it is&hellip;</p>
<p><em>(Note: if your supplemental income exceeds $1M then the amount over $1M is automatically withheld at the maximum 37%, the rate of the highest tax bracket. But any amount under $1M is withheld at 22% only.)</em></p>
<h2 id="number-crunching-intensifies">Number-crunching intensifies</h2>
<p>This can get especially dangerous around <strong>stock grants</strong>, especially if you go through an IPO and the stock price goes down afterward.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve been at your company for 3 years and they IPO!<br>
Here&rsquo;s a simplified model, say you have <strong>50,000 vested shares at $10/share = $500,000</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let&rsquo;s assume <strong>your tax basis is $500,000</strong> based on the $10 share price
<ul>
<li>Your tax basis is actually determined by the value of the shares at the time they land in your brokerage account (&ldquo;settle&rdquo;). This can be months after the actual IPO date so the share price, and therefore your tax basis, could be higher or lower</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Similar to your bonus, your $500,000 is withheld at ~40%, including the same 22% withholding for federal income tax = $200,000 withheld in total
<ul>
<li>With stock grants, your brokerage automatically sells stocks at settlement time to pay the withholding amount (&ldquo;sell-to-cover&rdquo;) = 20,000 shares sold at $10/share</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Again, federal withholding is only 22% = <strong>$110,000 withheld</strong> or 11,000 shares sold</li>
<li>Meanwhile you&rsquo;ll be held to ~34.7% in federal income tax on your $500K in stocks = <strong>$173,500 owed</strong>
<ul>
<li>This is &gt;32% because the $500K sum lands you to an even higher tax bracket</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So you owe an <strong>additional $63,000</strong> in taxes on your stocks after you get the 30,000 shares in hand</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, what happens if you decide to not sell your remaining shares and the share price drops to $5?</p>
<ul>
<li>Your tax bill remains unchanged (since it&rsquo;s based on the original tax basis) = <strong>$63,000 additional owed</strong></li>
<li>You have 30,000 shares in hand, now worth only $150,000</li>
<li>Meaning you&rsquo;d need to <strong>sell 12,600 of your 30,000 shares</strong> at $5/share to cover your tax bill (vs. only 6,300 shares at $10/share)</li>
</ul>
<p>You&rsquo;d need to sell a lot more shares to pay taxes in this case. You could even end up &ldquo;underwater&rdquo; (owing more than you have) if the stock price dips below $2.10.  Scary stuff.</p>
<p><em>Note: in this example you&rsquo;ll accumulate capital losses here at -$5/share sold, but a large amount of capital losses may be difficult to make use of in a timely manner.</em></p>
<p>So keep this in mind for any supplemental income you receive! You could owe thousands of dollars more in taxes on it than you were expecting. <strong>What I do:</strong> calculate how much extra tax I&rsquo;ll owe and set aside that amount immediately in a savings account just for tax season.</p>
