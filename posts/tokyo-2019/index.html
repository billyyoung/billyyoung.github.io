      <p><em>2023 Update: Check out my latest recs <a href="https://billy.dev/posts/tokyo-2023/">here</a>!</em></p>
<p>In the span of two weeks, 3 friends asked me for Tokyo recommendations from my trip earlier this year.  So I&rsquo;m putting those recommendations here as a sort of log / for future reference.</p>
<p>Here are some general tips on how to travel to Tokyo.  The rest is all about food, coffeeshops, and games (the majority of time spent during my recent trip).</p>
<p>Inspired by my friends&rsquo; recs (thanks Ophelia), <a href="https://thecupandtheroad.blogspot.com/">The Cup and the Road</a> blog (kinda broken now), and the random Swiss guy who told me about <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1066444-d11909267-Reviews-Kanemasu-Chuo_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html">Kanemasu</a> over tempura.</p>
<h2 id="logistics">Logistics</h2>
<p><strong>Flights</strong><br>
There are two airports you can fly to: Haneda airport (HND) and Narita airport (NRT).<br>
I&rsquo;d recommend HND over NRT if you have the choice.</p>
<p>HND is closer to Tokyo (45 mins to 1h for ~600 yen by subway) vs NRT (1h to 1.5h for ~3500 yen  by NRT Express + subway).</p>
<p><strong>Getting around Japan (some prep required)</strong><br>
If you&rsquo;ll be in Japan for over 7 days and plan to take the Shinkansen (high speed trains) between Tokyo, Kyoto/Osaka, and beyond, I&rsquo;d recommend getting the <strong>JR Pass</strong>.</p>
<p>This pass includes access to the Shinkansen (non-express lines) and any JR subway lines in Tokyo.  You can still buy these tickets yourself without a JR Pass, but buying the pass will likely save you some money in the end.</p>
<p>You can order the JR Pass online to either be shipped to you beforehand, or to be picked up at the airport.  They come in 7/14/21-day options.</p>
<p><strong>Stay</strong><br>
I&rsquo;d recommend staying in Shinjuku or Shibuya.  These areas have many subway lines in the area, lots of restaurants, and malls/shops.</p>
<p>For lodging, I&rsquo;d recommend either a hotel or Airbnb (some trade-offs mentioned below).</p>
<p><strong>Internet / Pocket Wifi</strong><br>
The most common way to have an internet connection during your trip is to get a Pocket Wifi &ndash; essentially a portable mobile hotspot.</p>
<p>You can order one online for pick-up/drop-off at the airport, and they cost ~$8 USD / day.  In the past I&rsquo;ve rented from Ninja Wifi and Wifi Hire without issue.</p>
<p>The battery life on these things tend to last most of the day, but you may want to bring a portable charger or switch it off when you&rsquo;re not using it just in case.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> some Airbnbs offer a complimentary Pocket Wifi for their guests, so you may not need to order one separately.</p>
<p><strong>Money</strong><br>
Japan is still a very cash-heavy country, with many small shops and restaurants not accepting credit card (larger establishments likely will though).</p>
<p>To exchange currency, the best places I&rsquo;ve seen are at these orange little FX exchange stores in the city, near the big train stations (e.g. there&rsquo;s at least one right by Shinjuku Station).  Apparently HND and NRT airports also provide pretty good rates too.  In the worst case there should be Travelex&rsquo;s around the city as well.</p>
<p><strong>Getting around Tokyo</strong><br>
May Google Maps guide you.</p>
<p>The subway system in Tokyo is extremely robust (with all signs translated in EN too) and reaches any popular areas.  I got around mainly by subway, or walking short distances.  I took the bus once.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a JR pass, you can get a metro card (either <strong>PASSMO</strong> or <strong>SUICA</strong>, but they function the same) at the airport or any subway station, and load money onto it as you&rsquo;d expect (cash only).  This lets you ride any subway line in Tokyo (vs the JR Pass only letting you ride on JR lines).</p>
<p>Subway fares are usually around 200 to 300 Yen one way.</p>
<p><strong>Restaurant reservations</strong><br>
In my experience, the easiest way to do this (without paying for additional services) is to have your hotel make the reservations for you by having the hotel staff call the restaurant to book.</p>
<h2 id="districts">Districts</h2>
<p>Recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Daikanyama &amp; Nakameguro</strong>: Two districts right next to each other that I&rsquo;d definitely recommend visiting.  <strong>Daikanyama</strong> is a beautifully hipster area full of cool clothing stores and small winding roads.  Check out the Tsutaya bookstore and the unique Starbucks located inside.  <strong>Nakameguro</strong> is home to the Meguro River which is <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BSe7IQMhc0H/">stunning</a> during cherry blossom season, and is lined with various cute shops for food/clothing/accessories.  The Tokyo <a href="https://www.starbucksreserve.com/en-us/locations/tokyo">Starbucks Reserve Roastery</a> is also here.</li>
<li><strong>Harajuku &amp; Omotesando</strong>: Another two districts that are right next to each other.  Walk down <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g14129746-d1373790-Reviews-Takeshita_Street-Jingumae_Shibuya_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html">Takeshita-dori Street</a> (a crazy dense street lined with cool shops) and people-watch.  There are also a lot of brand name stores in the area, as well as the popular <a href="http://www.spoon-tamago.com/2012/04/25/now-open-tokyu-plaza-omotesando-harajuku-by-hiroshi-nakamura/">kaleidoscope escalator</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Akihabara</strong>: Anime, electronics, and maid caf√©s.  Visit Mandarake for secondhand manga and other paraphernalia.  If you&rsquo;re looking for anime figurines, the prices can actually vary wildly between stores &ndash; I&rsquo;d recommend looking at shops that are farther away from Akihabara Station (e.g. TRADERS).</li>
<li><strong>Tsukiji Fish Market</strong>: This used to be where they did live tuna auctions every morning around 3 AM.
Those auctions have since moved to a different location and may not be open to the public any more &ndash; but the restaurants and shops that buy and serve the fish are still there.  Some shops open at 6:30 AM, but most other places open at 7:30 - 8:00 AM.  I&rsquo;d recommend getting there around 7 - 7:30 AM to check out some of the open spots and get a lay of the land before 8.  Notable foods are fresh sushi / sashimi bowls, unagi (eel), tamago (JP egg omelette, with sweet or salty options), oysters, and one place that has organ stew over rice.</li>
<li><strong>Shibuya</strong>: Mainly for the famous Shibuya Crossing.  There are also a lot of stores and restaurants in the area.</li>
<li><strong>Shinjuku</strong>: A bustling area with tons of restaurants, shops, and malls.  As in many malls/department stores within walking distance of each other. My go-to arcade spot was also here (Taito Game World).</li>
<li><strong>Asakusa</strong>: Visit <a href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3001.html">Sensoji Temple</a> and the shops that precede it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="food">Food</h2>
<p>Here are the places I ate at during my latest trip that I <strong>would recommend</strong>.  Most have English menus, unless otherwise stated.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.thetravelmentor.com/2019/05/nakiryu-michelin-star-tantanmen-ramen-tokyo-japan/">Nakiryu</a> (Minami-Otsuka)</strong>: Michelin-star ramen restaurant; very very good, and affordable (~1500 yen).  Vegetarian-friendly (I think).  This place opens at 11 AM and only seats 10, so the line gets long.  I&rsquo;d recommend going ~30 mins before they open (so 10:30 AM) on a weekday morning &ndash; I was seated in the 2nd batch and got out by 12 PM.  Order by vending machine (cash).</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.thewholeworldisaplayground.com/how-to-eat-tsuta-tokyo-michelin-star-ramen/">Tsuta</a> (Sugamo)</strong>: Michelin-star soba restaurant; very very good (and absolutely not like any of the global expansion locations, like in SF, which are awful).  Vegetarian-friendly (I think).  To eat here, you need to first buy a ticket to secure the time slot of your seating (first-come first-serve for 11-12, 12-1, or 1-2).  I&rsquo;d recommend buying a ticket around 8 AM for an 11 AM seating.  Order by vending machine (cash).</li>
<li><strong>Tsukemen Gonokami Seisakuso (Shinjuku)</strong>: Delicious shrimp tsukemen (dipping noodles) restaurant near Shinjuku Station.  This place opens at 11 AM and gets packed really quickly, so I&rsquo;d recommend going 10 mins before they open on a weekday morning.  Order by vending machine (cash).<br>
<em>Update; 2022: I still think about this tsukemen regularly.</em></li>
<li><strong>Matsubara-an (Harajuku)</strong>: Soba restaurant, serving hot and cold noodles.  Really nice dinner spot.  Vegetarian-friendly (I think). Reservation recommended.</li>
<li><strong>Ichiran (Asakusa)</strong>: One of the many locations of this ramen chain in Tokyo.  Solid and affordable (~1000 yen).  Vegetarian-friendly (I think).  Order via vending machine (cash).</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1066444-d11909267-Reviews-Kanemasu-Chuo_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html">Kanemasu</a> (Ginza)</strong>: This 12-person standing-bar-service-only restaurant is an absolute hidden gem.  Really fresh and exquisite seafood dishes.  I&rsquo;d highly recommend the wagyu + uni, and the crab salad.  Try to show up when they open at (I think) 3:30 PM (Google says 4 PM but I showed up then and it was already packed).  No English menu, but I was able to show them pictures of the dishes on my phone that I wanted to order (see link).  Cash only.</li>
<li><strong>Katsukura (Shinjuku)</strong>: Katsu restaurant with high quality meat, located on the 14th floor of the Takashimaya mall.  Reservation likely not needed, but it can get busy.</li>
<li><strong>Tsunahachi (Shinjuku)</strong>: Tempura restaurant with various prix fixe and √† la carte options for seafood, fish, and vegetables.  Reservation likely not needed, but it can get busy.</li>
<li><strong>Numazuko (Shinjuku)</strong>: Solid conveyor belt sushi spot.  Unbelievable quality and freshness for the price, for someone coming from the US (e.g. $5 for 2pc otoro nigiri).  Revisited multiple times on the same trip.  Opens at 11 AM and can get pretty busy by 11:30 AM.</li>
<li><strong>Nabezo (Shinjuku)</strong>: Shabu shabu (JP hot pot) restaurant with high quality meat.  Reservation recommended.</li>
<li><strong>Omoide Yokocho AKA Piss Alley (Shinjuku)</strong>: Divey alleyway full of yakitori (grilled skewers) spots.  Most places only have seats for 10-ish.  Cool vibes, and good for some late night grilled meat (chicken skin!) and beer.</li>
<li><strong>Katsuo (Shinjuku)</strong>: Dive-y kara-age (fried chicken) and beer/highball chain restaurant.  500 yen for fried chicken and 200 yen for a beer/highball.  Try the fried gizzard too.</li>
<li><strong>KINTAN (Harajuku)</strong>: Yakiniku (JP BBQ) restaurant with some high quality beef.  Reservations available.</li>
<li><strong>Dashi Chazuke (Shinjuku)</strong>: Tiny chazuke place (tea + dashi over rice) in Shinjuku Station; good for a light breakfast.  Order via vending machine (cash).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="coffeekissaten">Coffee/Kissaten</h2>
<p>A large chunk of my 2019 trip was sitting down at various coffeeshops with a good book.  Thankfully, from a friend&rsquo;s recommendation, I discovered the <em>Kissaten</em> scene in Tokyo.</p>
<p><em>Kissaten</em> are Japanese-style tearooms/coffee shops.  Most are from/based on the Showa Era in Japan (1926 - 1989), and have signature wood counters and serve you pour-over coffee in a china teacup.</p>
<p>Caf√©s, in descending order of how much I liked them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://peoplemakeplaces.com/place/chatei-hatou/">Chatei Hatou</a> (Shibuya)</strong>: Beautiful and classy kissaten.  Their aged coffee is a must-try.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://tajimaya-coffeeten.com/">Tajimaya Coffee</a> (Shinjuku)</strong>: Another great kissaten.  Would recommend the Choco-Nut Toast set (comes with coffee).  Can get packed on weekends, and is a smoking establishment.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://tokyocoffee.org/2016/05/29/cafe-de-lambre/">Cafe de l&rsquo;ambre</a> (Ginza)</strong>: Get their specialty: the Blanc &amp; Noir.  They chill their coffee by putting it in a cocktail mixer and spinning it on a giant slab of ice!</li>
<li><strong>Onibus Coffee (Nakameguro)</strong>: Cute storefront with an upstairs with treehouse vibes</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.starbucksreserve.com/en-us/locations/tokyo">Starbucks Reserve Roastery</a> (Nakameguro)</strong>: Beautiful location with 3 floors and a terrace</li>
<li><strong>Starbucks in Tsutaya Books (Daikanyama)</strong>: Very cool interior, though mainly to walk through</li>
<li>&ndash; Below these ones are just &lsquo;alright&rsquo; &ndash;</li>
<li><strong>Mocha Coffee (Daikanyama)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Coffee Seibu (Shinjuku)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Bees Coffee (Sugamo)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Blue Bottle Coffee (Shinjuku)</strong>: Pretty standard BB, can get surprisingly busy</li>
<li><strong>Starbucks (Shibuya)</strong>: See Shibuya Crossing from the 2nd floor</li>
<li><strong>Galant (Ueno)</strong>: The waittresses are all in maid outfits, and the decor was a bit lifeless; coffee and cake were just ok</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="arcade-games">Arcade Games</h2>
<p>The other large portion of my time was spent at the arcade, mostly playing a rhythm game called <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Chunithm">Chunithm</a>.</p>
<p>This game is both fun to watch and very fun to play.  Chunithm involves tapping/holding notes, plus raising your hand in the air and lowering it on beat to hit &ldquo;air notes&rdquo;.  See some high level gameplay <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkKWpSJkxUI">here</a>.</p>
<p>Besides rhythm games (including piano-, guitar-, drum-, and DJ-based games), arcades have online arena games (e.g. Gundam battles), token games (where you buy tokens to play games that give you tokens, but tokens can&rsquo;t be traded in for real money&hellip;), and photo booths. And, of course, crane/prize games on the 1st floor.</p>
<p>My go-to arcade is the Taito Station Game World near Shinjuku Station.  It was close to my hotel, close to food/boba, and had 5 full Chunithm setups (with phone mounts) and 3 Love Live setups.</p>
<hr>
<p>P.S. Please send any Tokyo recommendations you have!  I&rsquo;ll be going again in 2020 to watch the Olympics and I&rsquo;m always interested in trying new/cool things.<br>
