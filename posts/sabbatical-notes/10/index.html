      <p>So… I’m in grad school! I&rsquo;m doing a PsyD program to become a licensed therapist. (I&rsquo;ve been jokingly calling it &ldquo;therapist school&rdquo;.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in the swing of things now, and it&rsquo;s great. There&rsquo;s no place I&rsquo;d rather be. But getting here was a bit tumultuous, and I was riddled with indecision in Jan-Feb 2025, which is what I want to document here.</p>
<h2 id="context">Context</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;d been floating the idea of going to &ldquo;therapist school&rdquo; since ~2024. I had just tried (and burnt out on) bootstrapping my own service doing career coaching, and I was looking at other paths for doing 1:1 work. And then I happened to meet several people who were career-switching into therapy, and had either just started their grad school program in counseling or were about to start.</p>
<p>This expanded my realm of possibilities, firmly planting the seed of <em>&ldquo;Oh I could actually do this too!&rdquo;</em> into my mind, where it hadn&rsquo;t existed before. And once this seed was planted, it started to take root.</p>
<p>I began to connect the dots looking backward. <em>&ldquo;You know, I do spend a lot of my spare time on youtube watching 1:1 conversations and videos on psychology, mental health, and philosophy of mind. Maybe this is a sign that I might actually enjoy formally studying these things. 🤔&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Still, for most of 2024 I categorized &lsquo;apply to grad school&rsquo; as one of my crazier ideas, on par with &lsquo;apply to art school to become a classical oil painter&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. It was definitely <em>possible</em>, but it was not probable.</p>
<p>But then near the end of 2024, I started to yearn for <a target="_blank" href="https://billy.dev/posts/sabbatical-notes/9/">Good Work</a> again, which eventually led to me deciding I was going to apply to grad school in late Dec. I still wasn&rsquo;t all-in – my attitude to applying was more like, “F*ck it, I’ll apply and we&rsquo;ll see what happens.” As if this was just the latest project idea that could either take off or be scrapped if it didn’t work. If I didn&rsquo;t get in, well I still had other options and I would move on to the next thing.</p>
<h2 id="trial-run">Trial run</h2>
<p>So I rushed out applications. The details of the application process aren&rsquo;t that important, except for one: if I were to get into a PsyD (&ldquo;Doctor of Psychology&rdquo;) program, there were a handful of pre-req psych classes I&rsquo;d need to complete in order to start. Up to four different ones. So I got started on those right away too.</p>
<p>This ended up also serving as a really nice experiment for me to dip my toes into schooling again to see if I would hate it or not, which is something I was worried about.</p>
<p>But it was largely enjoyable! It turns out that when you’re studying topics you actually have some interest in (psychology), the weekly readings can actually be engaging.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>But alas, school is never going to be as fun as being on a sabbatical. Coming from a STEM background it was my first time doing readings-based courses, which I learned have their own flavour of Sisyphean trudging to them. There came a point around week 5 or 6 out of 12 in the semester, where the days were starting to feel mind-numbing and never-ending. Read textbooks, watch lecture videos, do assignments, and repeat.</p>
<p>And the doubt started creeping in.</p>
<p>I missed the freedom of my sabbatical, where I was working on fun creative projects at my own pace.</p>
<p>But I had felt adrift and antsy from having no broader direction…</p>
<p>And grad school would be very directed (toward a new career as a therapist)! It would be a clear path laid out for me. But it’d be ~5 years of grind ahead, and I&rsquo;d have to pause most of my fun creative projects…</p>
<p>I kept cycling through each idea, flip-flopping. And in particular I kept identifying <em>things I didn’t like</em> about each path, which left me feeling stuck.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="wtf-was-i-doing">WTF was I doing</h2>
<p>It was at this point that I caught myself.</p>
<p>In the span of two months, I’d gone from: being tired of being on sabbatical and wanting to do something more significant → to applying to grad school → to trying out coursework → to feeling tired of coursework and wanting to play all day again.</p>
<p>What was this flip-flopping?</p>
<p><strong>Was I just chasing positive feeling? Was I a slave to it?</strong></p>
<p>This thought scared me and frustrated me enough to try to figure out what the f*ck I could do about this. Being stuck in indecision <em>sucked</em>. And it also seemed like a common human experience, and thus smarter folks than me must have some clearer understanding of this phenomenon and how to deal with it.</p>
<p>So as I tend to do, I turned to youtube and watched a bunch of Dr. K lectures about indecision. This was pivotal, as I had to come to understand that <strong>I was afraid</strong>.</p>
<p>I was afraid of making the wrong decision, wasting time, or ending up screwed. (And why make a hard decision that could turn out badly, when you can just play all day?)</p>
<p>And I was running away from the fear, which affirmed that the fear was worth running away from, which made it more powerful.</p>
<h2 id="understanding">Understanding</h2>
<p>One way to work through this kind of fear is to understand it.</p>
<p>Through understanding the <a target="_blank" href="https://billy.dev/posts/indecision/">mechanics of indecision</a> and where the fear was coming from, I was able to see it more for what it was.</p>
<p>I was afraid of making the wrong decision, wasting time, and potentially ending up in a worse position. But actually &ldquo;making the wrong decision&rdquo; is a subpar frame. Not to say that you won&rsquo;t ever end up screwed, e.g. due to things outside of your control. You might. Shit happens.</p>
<p>But largely it&rsquo;s not the decision that determines the outcome, it&rsquo;s how you act after the decision has been made. You have the power and agency to respond, iterate, or change course.</p>
<p>And somehow through understanding this and accepting it, the fear dissolved and I knew what I had to do.</p>
<h2 id="choosing-focus">Choosing &lsquo;Focus&rsquo;</h2>
<p>I learned that fulfillment and purpose come from choosing <em>something</em> that&rsquo;s in line with what you want to do. Just choose something, make <em>a</em> choice, and then commit to it (until things start to fray). Choose &lsquo;focus&rsquo;, and then enjoyment comes from being in the flow of working on that thing that you chose.</p>
<p>And if things start looking grim, choose what you want to do in response.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>So far, my choice to do grad school has been working out. There&rsquo;s no place I&rsquo;d rather be right now.</p>
