      <p><em>Covers Nov 2023 to Jan 2024.</em></p>
<p>After the dust settled in <a target="_blank" href="https://billy.dev/posts/sabbatical-notes/4/">October</a>, my experiences and my new mindset coalesced into these two goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Continue to do the creative work that I love, and do whatever I need to in order to sustain this; while in the background:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rewire myself away from grasping for external validation of my work as a necessary component of my worth, and toward cultivating an internal wellspring of self-worth</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With (2), I realize now, truly realize, that a big part of me <em>doesn&rsquo;t like myself</em>.</p>
<p>The writing was on the wall, though, for a long time. The negative self-talk (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m an idiot!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Tsk, that was dumb&rdquo;). That little trail of darkness that led toward the root of my desire to do better, that I turned my eyes away from and didn&rsquo;t want to follow. The desire to Be Better. And the harshness which I employed to try to fulfill that desire, that would sometimes leak out into my interactions with other people.</p>
<p>(Side thought I had recently: is there this bit of darkness inside all those who tend J on the MBTI?)</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s this feeling of confused shame that arises when I admit to myself that I don&rsquo;t really like me. How can I not like myself? The only existence I&rsquo;ve got is this one, my own! Also, there&rsquo;s so much to like! Also, only people with <strong>issues</strong> don&rsquo;t like themselves, and I couldn&rsquo;t be one of <strong>those</strong> people. And yet, it rings True.</p>
<p>Accepting this feels a bit icky to me still in some unclear way, but it&rsquo;s also freeing. It makes sense! I&rsquo;m starting to notice more when I&rsquo;m making certain decisions where I want to be seen as good, and noticing that I want to be liked (by myself or someone else).</p>
<p>Though it could also just be like this <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/eigenrobot/status/967114911401652225">evergreen tweet</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>So what now?</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">haha imagine if by the end of this year I successfully rewire my brain through internal and external work to build a vast wellspring of self-love that becomes a cornerstone of my self-worth and being haha that&#39;d be crazy right haha</p>&mdash; billy (@billyisyoung) <a href="https://twitter.com/billyisyoung/status/1742670293154570735?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 3, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>Well, I want to start liking myself. I want to have a healthy, internalized sense of self-worth. In fact, I&rsquo;ll go as far as to say I want <strong>Self-Love</strong>.</p>
<p>As for actual actions, from what I&rsquo;ve read plus talking with my therapist, this all takes a rewiring of the neurons in the brain. Negative self-talk must become positive self-talk, and this must become unconscious.</p>
<p>This kind of rewiring takes <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/billyisyoung/status/1469531249555378176">many months</a>, and looks something like:</p>
<p><em>Be aware of the negative thoughts, or grasping at external validation -&gt; when the thoughts arise, be curious, examine and investigate them -&gt; propose and reinforce some new, more positive thoughts that you believe. Meanwhile, just keep living your life.</em></p>
<p>Other things I&rsquo;ll be looking into:</p>
<ul>
<li>MettƒÅ (loving kindness) meditation</li>
<li>Saying positive affirmations to myself in the mirror (I think research actually does say that this works)</li>
<li>Whatever else comes up as I&rsquo;m surfing the web</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ll see how things are going at the end of Q1 2024 or so. But I&rsquo;m excited and optimistic :)</p>
<p>(Interestingly, it feels like NOW I&rsquo;m in a state where I&rsquo;m able to really fully enjoy my sabbatical. Like, what I&rsquo;m feeling and doing now are what I think people expect when I say I&rsquo;m on sabbatical, except it took me a whole Act I to get here üòÇ)</p>
