      <p>This past May, I started feeling like I&rsquo;d been doing Fun Projects for long enough. Since July 2023 I&rsquo;d been fighting (with love) my urge/anxiety around needing to feel productive, make money, and get back to self-sufficiency, by reconnecting to my sense of Fun and doing Fun Projects.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> But after ~10 months of this, I was feeling a bit hedonistic, and I was suddenly motivated again to work on my career. So the pendulum swings.</p>
<p>I decided to give Coaching another shot, as the most viable candidate for a possible career switch that I could test out immediately. But due to some unlucky timing, I had this burst of motivation right before a series of family + travel plans that kept me away from home for ~3 months, from the end of June to the end of September.</p>
<p>October 2024 was when I was finally back and settled in, and started tackling these new ideas for realâ€“now with Coaching as the primary career thing, and Drawing as the secondary thing I wanted to be more serious about (upping my drawing time from ~30 mins every other day, to 1h/day).<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> And then try some stock trading on the side too for fun (this is foreshadowing). I&rsquo;d dedicate 6 months to really give these ideas a fair shake and see if they had any legs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now November, 1/6 of the way through, and things are going OK. Building this coaching business has primarily bottlenecked on lead gen and client acquisition work, which I feel lots of resistance toward. But it enables me to do the actual thing I like to do, which is talk to people one-on-one (which I got to do 12 times in Oct!). Coming to this realization in itself means this experiment is working, and that&rsquo;s hearteningâ€“I&rsquo;ve put in some work, revealed more of the territory, and I&rsquo;m now processing new data. Next: it&rsquo;s seeing &ldquo;how do you live off of crumbs as you wait for the next hit of magic,&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> and if this is the sh*t sandwich I actually want to be eating for a while.</p>
<p><big>*</big></p>
<p>Another recent catalyst for reflection has been <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/p_millerd">Paul Millerd</a>&rsquo;s new book <a target="_blank" href="https://pmillerd.com/goodwork/">Good Work</a>, whose premise is essentially captured in the very first line: <em>&ldquo;Could it be this simple? Just do things you like?&rdquo;</em> I&rsquo;m only 1/3 of the way through, but so far it&rsquo;s been right up my alley as I&rsquo;m constructing this new life for myself around this exact idea of Good Work.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s brought back to mind long-standing questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What am I always doing?</li>
<li>What would I do even if I knew I wasn&rsquo;t going to be paid for it?</li>
<li>Or even better &ndash; what would <em>I pay</em> to spend time on?</li>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/billyisyoung/status/1706728196199399486">What can I do for 8 hours a day that won&rsquo;t make me want to bash my head into a wall?</a></li>
<li>How does this all square with my preference to cycle through a few different projects in a day?</li>
</ul>
<p>Funnily enough, literally just last night I went to bed late because I was watching a bunch of videos covering the stock market, and only realized today that it was because I was having Fun<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. And maybe I should do more of this and see how that feels ðŸ¤”. (I also noticed that I have some internal resistance to the idea of being seen as a &ldquo;stocks guy&rdquo;&hellip; but if it&rsquo;s fun it&rsquo;s fun, what can you do?)</p>
<p>And at a meta level, you could even say that what I&rsquo;m doing right now with this exploration is itself the Good Work, the thing I&rsquo;m meant to do. I&rsquo;ve set aside the time for this 6-month experiment. I&rsquo;ve got ample runway. All I have is time. Any anxiety is then, in a sense, not real<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>; I&rsquo;ve just gotta do what I can do today. Any outcomes are out of my hands.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m exactly where I need to be.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s funny, looking back now, I can see that even my decision to do Fun Projects was still steeped in that same desire to be productive â€“ I couldn&rsquo;t just Have Fun by wasting time. (And I still can&rsquo;t, really.) The Fun Projects I chose still had to be <em>producing</em> some tangible result, and had to help me level up skills that I cared about. HOWEVER I still think this was a step in the right direction, toward having more Fun. It&rsquo;s all baby steps.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Some days all of this feels like a big headfake &ndash; that by having this &lsquo;reasonable&rsquo; primary objective (Coaching), I could give myself a cover to secretly do the REAL thing I wanted to do more of (Drawing)&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>John Mayer on the songwriting process, from his Tetragrammaton interview with Rick Rubin. Highly recommended, especially if you do creative stuff. (<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/billyisyoung/status/1709400703788294357">summary thread</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaaOoyclkE8">source video</a>)&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<li id="fn:4">
<p>My friend asked me what&rsquo;s fun about it, and I thought it was worth including here:<br>
- Autonomy - my actions are all within my control, as to how much I research, which stocks I pick, relative performance vs SPY<br>
(vs coaching right now what&rsquo;s in my control is putting stuff out there, but what&rsquo;s not in my control is how many clients sign up)<br>
- It&rsquo;s kind of a game, like looking at data and finding gems<br>
- It feels like a more legible and direct path to wealth creation and financial freedom, which I think is an anxiety for me right now&#160;<a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<li id="fn:5">
<p>The anxieties I&rsquo;m feeling in the moment are worries about the future. But also: they are just thoughts about some <strong>imagined</strong> future state, and they don&rsquo;t really change what I need to do today. So I try to let them just pass on by as I focus on what I can do today.&#160;<a href="#fnref:5" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
