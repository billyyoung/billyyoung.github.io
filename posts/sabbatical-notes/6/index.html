      <p>Writing my previous <a target="_blank" href="https://billy.dev/posts/becoming-a-fit-person/">blog post</a> took a lot out of me, to the point where I started looking forward to being done with the post halfway through the writing process. I&rsquo;m glad I wrote it, but I&rsquo;m also glad it&rsquo;s over with. After publishing the post, I took a week off from writing. I still <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/billyy_art/">drew</a> portrait studies and practiced the drums, but I filled the extra time with books, video games, and… just pondering what else to do. Which led me to thinking: what if I don&rsquo;t get another blog post idea for weeks?</p>
<p><em>Is this just how the days will pass by?</em></p>
<p><em>When do I &ldquo;make it&rdquo;?</em></p>
<p><em>Is this it?</em></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I was between writing projects. But I was, and still am, also squarely in the long middle of living the creative life I <strong>wanted and had chosen for myself</strong>, centered around:</p>
<ol>
<li><a target="_blank" href="https://billy.dev/posts/sabbatical-notes/5/">Developing more self-love and contentment</a></li>
<li>Doing the creative work I love</li>
<li>Doing what&rsquo;s necessary to support 1 and 2</li>
</ol>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s because my direction is process-oriented (as opposed to results-oriented), and I&rsquo;m realizing that that can be a bit… well… disorienting.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really have quantified long-term goals (just a couple of <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/billyisyoung/status/1549125937207189504">vague</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/billyisyoung/status/1653229341537607680">dreams</a>). I&rsquo;m not building any one single thing, like a business or a product. (Though in a sense you could say that <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/lainewrites/status/1703974936098873697">I am the product</a>.) I don&rsquo;t have any sort of &ldquo;roadmap&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t know where I&rsquo;ll be at the end of this year.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no definitive finish line. I go, until I don&rsquo;t want to go any more. Maybe I&rsquo;m just in a liminal space between projects or story arcs, and I&rsquo;m getting antsy and pensive. &ldquo;I built X. Then I built Y. Then I built Z. Now what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Does this feeling go away when you have clear goals? (Does having clear goals mean you&rsquo;ve figured all of this out for yourself already, enough to be able to form clear goals?) Or are clear goals just an illusion–am I actually just the one dangling the carrot in front of my own face to trick myself into motion, to some dreamed-up end? Will I immediately move the goalpost further ahead once I&rsquo;ve reached it?</p>
<p>Life seems less complicated when you&rsquo;re handed defined problems to solve by the world–it&rsquo;s how the bulk of our early lives are structured, in school and work. &ldquo;Do X by deadline Y, because we say so. And if you keep it up you&rsquo;ll be on track to succeed in the next stage,&rdquo; be it high school, college, getting a job, getting promoted, etc. This is much easier than, say, really paying attention to our internal self to pinpoint what we actually want and what brings us alive.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m at the point in my life where I&rsquo;ve learned that what the world tells me to do isn&rsquo;t very aligned with what I actually want to do. Achieving some result isn&rsquo;t going to make the empty feelings go away. Other people&rsquo;s milestones may make us envious and get us thinking that that&rsquo;s what we might want too. But they&rsquo;re actually useful only as reference of what is possible, and not necessarily what will make <em>you</em> happy. You have to find your own path, based on your sense of Fun and where it takes you. As cliché as it sounds, the answers really do lie within; happiness is developed from within.</p>
<p>I return to this time and time again: the answer is internal, i.e. inside yourself and only yourself, and it&rsquo;s different for everyone. How do you yourself relate to goals? What are you trying to do?</p>
<p>My questions <em>&ldquo;When do I &lsquo;make it&rsquo;?&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;Is this it?&rdquo;</em> are questions expectant of something. They&rsquo;re demanding <em>more</em>. They believe that some future circumstance or result is going to appease me.<br>
<em>&ldquo;Is this it? (There must be something else out there that&rsquo;s more pleasing than this.)&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>I. want. more.</p>
<p>And what <em>this</em> really gets back to, is not feeling <strong>content</strong> in the present. Feeling like I need something else, something to change or to be added or subtracted, in order to be happy.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I wrote most of the post above two weeks ago, before taking another break. I&rsquo;d tried to wrap things up at that time, but I couldn&rsquo;t find anything to say that I was happy with. It was all tense, grasping, effortful; or just full of platitudes that felt empty to me at the time. So I left this one out to air-dry.</p>
<p>I went outside. I talked with friends and new acquaintances. I took a separate 1-week break from lifting. I was able to relax a bit. The mind rests and resets, and the pendulum swings back the other way.</p>
<p>I remembered that this is why I want to do that internal work of developing more self-love. I was reminded that I believe that better is possible, and that <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/billyisyoung/status/1788720130270310806">I have faith in the process</a>. And I remembered that the best I can do is just <strong>build what I enjoy building (and eventually do that in community)</strong>.</p>
<p>I was reminded that: all there is is the present. Stress and worry come from thinking about some future state. But whether stress is present or not doesn&rsquo;t change the fact that all you can do is do your best, now.</p>
<p>Do something today that you&rsquo;ll be proud of when you go to bed. And then wake up and do it again. The rest is out of your hands.</p>
