      <p>Since its inception, my France trip has sort of been a plan of conflict.</p>
<p><em>A chance to watch the Olympics live? Hell yeah! <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></em><br>
<em>A chance to live out a childhood dream of residing in France for a couple months? Hell yeah!!</em><br>
<em>Except August is also the most excited I&rsquo;ve been to go all-in on spinning up a coaching business… which I can&rsquo;t really do while I&rsquo;m on vacation in France.</em></p>
<p>I had another experience this past year of feeling guilt/FOMO about taking a vacation when I wanted to be working on projects, and what helped greatly was introspecting and processing and coming to accept that (1) yes I would like to work on projects, but (2) I also want this vacation and to have a good time and that time is also a gift to myself, so let me consciously choose this trade-off so I can be fully present on my vacation to enjoy it to the fullest.</p>
<p>I tried to reach that same acceptance this time too buuuuut it didn&rsquo;t really work. So now I&rsquo;m one week into the final leg of my trip (a month-long stay in Paris) and there&rsquo;s this pit of discomfort that&rsquo;s found itself in my stomach.</p>
<p>If I <strong>work</strong> (fun), I also think &ldquo;well why the hell am I wasting resources staying in <em>Paris</em> if I&rsquo;m just going to be inside my airbnb all day?&rdquo;<br>
If I go <strong>sightseeing</strong> (fun), I also think &ldquo;OK, but I&rsquo;m kinda hitting my limit on my sightseeing. Also I feel like I&rsquo;m just consuming, when I want to be producing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If I <strong>cook</strong> for myself in my airbnb (fun, healthy), I also think &ldquo;why am I sitting here eating chicken breast?&rdquo;<br>
If I <strong>eat out</strong> (yum), I also think &ldquo;this is starting to get a bit indulgent, in food or cost or both&rdquo;</p>
<p>One thing that still feels good though, whether in Paris or SF, is hitting the gym and getting those post-workout endorphins. Writing feels good too.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not entirely sure where to go from here, but I&rsquo;m figuring it out. Some scattered thoughts include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Binary A-or-B thinking is a trap, life isn&rsquo;t just either/or, there&rsquo;s balance to be had</li>
<li>But also there&rsquo;s value in whole-assing one thing, vs half-assing two things</li>
<li>Recognize the resistance, embrace it, ask it questions out of genuine curiosity, follow whatever feels strongest at the moment</li>
<li>Do what feels good <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></li>
<li>The root of this conflict is probably just the self-worth stuff again – me feeling like I haven&rsquo;t done enough and I&rsquo;m not doing enough (and if only I could do enough, then that would make me feel like enough)</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m going to shower (I&rsquo;m writing this post-gym) and then go outside and touch grass. Then we&rsquo;ll see what else I feel like doing.</p>

<p>I never actually considered the idea of going to watch the Olympics in person until 2019 when I saw you could sign up for the Tokyo 2020 ticket lottery. But once it seemed within the realm of possibility I was hooked. Especially for Tokyo. It was double the treat, like indulging in a two-scoop ice cream cone at the store instead of a single. Of course, Tokyo 2020 didn&rsquo;t pan out and my tickets got refunded. Then came Paris 2024, a second double treat opportunity…&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>I often notice that I look back fondly on times when my schedule is so packed that I don&rsquo;t really have time to sit and ponder (and overthink, probably). But is that just a form of running away? You can&rsquo;t hide from yourself and your thoughts forever. And I think it&rsquo;d be nice to get to the point of being able to sit alone, with no plans, and be at peace.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
