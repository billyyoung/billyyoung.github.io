      <p>I feel like I&rsquo;m wasting away.</p>
<p>I spend ~10 hours each weekday within the world of Work, and I no longer enjoy it (but oh how I used to!). I scramble around, I&rsquo;m in meetings, I help with planning, I get pinged and pulled into conversatons. I get annoyed with people and their incompetence, and my own incompetence. I avoid the work I need to do (Why? Don&rsquo;t want to face reality. Of what? That I have to get this boring-ass sh*t done? idk). I&rsquo;m learning still, but what I&rsquo;m learning now is mostly <em>&lsquo;How to Improve Coordination and Cross-Functional Collaboration&rsquo;</em> (vs more technical skills). And coordination problems are annoying.</p>
<p>So I rebel, I slack off, I procrastinate, I don&rsquo;t fully focus on work. I half-work throughought the day, which extends my working hours because of guilt plus the actual things that need to get done.</p>
<p>There are very few days now where I feel satisfied, like &ldquo;OK I got a lot done today&rdquo; in the sense of deep, meaningful work (that doesn&rsquo;t involve me doing some rogue coding; a sign, maybe). It feels like choppy work salad, and it&rsquo;s really not doing it for me. I often find myself saying to myself, &ldquo;I wish I could retire,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to work&rdquo;.</p>
<p>How did I get here?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been at my company for a while now (6.5 years!). But the last two and a half years, basically starting with COVID, have felt kinda like I&rsquo;ve been stuck on rails. I&rsquo;m only really noticing it now, looking back while writing this.</p>
<p>I reached <em>minor Guru</em> status (I&rsquo;m half-joking here). And then the company wants to use you for more high-leverage work. But the qualities that get you to become a Guru in the first place are not indicative of if you will like or succeed in this higher role. I was a domain owner and then I grew into a leader within my org, partly out of my own interest in taking on the role but also partly out of a sense of duty and necessity.</p>
<p>Right now, I do a lot of planning and very little coding. <em>And after writing this all out, I think I&rsquo;m in the wrong role for me!</em></p>
<p>&hellip;</p>
<p>So what now? I can think of a few steps forward:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tweak existing systems and hand them off to new folks to take over</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then move to a new team/domain and restart my Guru journey again</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Or&hellip; just leave and do something else</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Or maybe there is a way to transform my current role into something where I do get to code, and tinker, and go into the weeds more. We&rsquo;ll see what I can do here.</p>
<h2 id="further-reading--footnotes">Further reading / footnotes</h2>
<p><sup>1</sup> There&rsquo;s a suggestion in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3pzcV9yi24">this video</a> from A Life Engineered (a Principal Eng @ Amazon), where you heavily prioritize completing The Most Imporant Things you need to do that day, preferably within a reserved block of 3-4 hours on your calendar. I thought, maybe if I did this I would feel accomplished. But I even had trouble implementing this because I think my premise was flawed, in that, I understood the work was important but I was not engaged in the work. So I never ended up feeling accomplished or satisfied, even if I did eventually get the important stuff done one way or the other.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup> Maybe we should adjust how we think about career development and levels for software engineers&ndash;it&rsquo;s a lot from how I grew up and went through school, but if there&rsquo;s levels I feel the need to keep Leveling Up! The higher the better, always!! And that&rsquo;s just not the case (I even <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/billyisyoung/status/1481859514013999107">tweeted</a> about this almost exactly 1 year ago!). Out of L4, L5, L6, maybe you actually like being an L4 the most and you&rsquo;re damn good at it. (And there&rsquo;s a lot of value in working with someone who is an excellent coder and collaborator.) Maybe the IC track should split into Coding vs Technical Design or something like that. Maybe I needed to be up for promo for L6 to see this, idk. I have a couple of friends like this who keep refusing promotions, and now I think they&rsquo;re geniuses.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup> I recently made a video talking about why I switched from EM back to IC. But I think this post is already an iteration on those thoughts, since now I have a better picture of the kind of IC work I want to be doing.</p>
