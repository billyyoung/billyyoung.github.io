      <p><em>Inspired by <a target="_blank" href="https://ninetydays.substack.com/p/day-15-reality-check">this post</a>, and the question &ldquo;What <em>do</em> I love?&rdquo;</em><br>
<em>(If you like, you can <a href="#tell-me">skip ahead</a> to the prescriptive stuff.)</em></p>
<p>I feel like some people will find this question absurd, because to them it&rsquo;s obvious. &ldquo;You like what you like,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;you just know, you can feel it.&rdquo; But you only ask the question when it becomes a question; there are times when the answer is very not-obvious.</p>
<p>Looking back at my own life, I see that my sense of what I liked was muddy, a melting pot of what I wanted, what I thought I wanted, what I thought I should be doing, what I didn&rsquo;t even know I wanted, and more. I made decisions based on what I found fun, but also based on other ego-desires looking to be fulfilled, like wanting to be successful, or wanting to be a Good Boy, or wanting to feel like I was better than others, or wanting to be relied upon.</p>
<p>And honestly this worked for me for most of my 20s. I enjoyed my life. I got sh*t done. But at some point cracks started to appear. There was a feeling of discord that wasn&rsquo;t noticeable at first, but started to build and build. And it wasn&rsquo;t going away, to the point where I had to ask myself: &ldquo;What are we going to do about this?&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">things that are useful to figure out for yourself (non-comprehensive):<br><br>- your needs<br>- what you like<br>- what you can do for hours on end<br>- how to take care of yourself<br>- how you like to work<br>- how you like to play<br>- your misconceptions about reality</p>&mdash; billy (@billyisyoung) <a href="https://twitter.com/billyisyoung/status/1802205881939198266?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 16, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>I&rsquo;ve started to think that a life well-lived is one where you&rsquo;re living with a sense of internal harmony. You have agency, you are making decisions and moving in the direction you want to be moving in, and you are fully aware of the trade-offs that you&rsquo;re opting in to.</p>
<p>You know what you like, and you are Doing Things that you&rsquo;re proud of.</p>
<p>… so how do we actually do this?</p>
<p><small><em>A quick disclaimer: I&rsquo;m just a guy writing words on the internet. Maybe what I&rsquo;m about to say  works, maybe I find out a year from now that I was totally off base. Really the core thing to do is just look within yourself; you know what is harmonious for you, you know what you like.</em></small></p>
<p><strong>Try stuff, do things, and then check in with yourself.</strong> (And be honest.)</p>
<p><strong>Develop sensitivity to the feeling of Liking stuff.</strong> There&rsquo;s a muscle there, a sense organ to be attuned and trained. And there&rsquo;s a lot of external interference to filter out.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, <strong>develop sensitivity to what harmony feels like for you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introspect.</strong> Some prompts that I like to revisit: <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>What do I like? Why?</li>
<li>What are the moments in my life when I had the most fun?</li>
<li>What do I value?</li>
<li>What am I a sicko about? (positive)</li>
<li>What do I feel is important for me to do?</li>
<li>If I do X, will that make me feel proud? (vs just placated or relieved)
_ If I stripped away the external results from doing X, would I still do it? e.g. money, status, prestige, receiving appreciation</li>
<li>Am I taking sufficient care of myself?</li>
<li>What would help me feel more internal harmony?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Develop awareness of when you are seeking answers externally.</strong> E.g. What are other people doing? How do I beat this person? I want what she has. This is a trap, since the answers you actually want are within you, and won&rsquo;t be found external to you. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>

<p>At some point recently, I fell back to asking myself <a target="_blank" href="https://billy.dev/posts/sabbatical-notes/6/">&ldquo;Is this it?&quot;</a>. I&rsquo;ve been doing what I like, now where does this lead? Or is this ultimately just a form of hedonism? But now with the ideas of &lsquo;harmony&rsquo; and &rsquo;taking care of yourself&rsquo;, I think I&rsquo;m more OK with it.</p>
<p><strong>Nurture your harmony. Take care of yourself. Build what you enjoy building, and eventually do it in community.</strong></p>
<p>That feels pretty good. That feels sufficient. If things start devolving into hedonism or if disharmony starts to spread, I think I&rsquo;ll realize it (eventually), and then course-correct. Otherwise, I&rsquo;m on the path and moving forward, and that&rsquo;s all I can really hope for day to day.</p>

<em>&ldquo;I don’t know who I am, and at the same time, I dislike who I am and how I act. I&rsquo;ve spent my life molding myself to please those around me, seeking their approval, trying to make them laugh, often at my own expense. This has left me feeling like a fraud, unable to live according to my values (whatever they are)&rdquo;</em><br>

<p>A friend asked me to share some of my answers to these introspection prompts, so here we go:<br>
1. <strong>What I like / what do I value?</strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://billy.dev/start-here">See here.</a><br>
2. <strong>Moments when I had the most fun?</strong> Often related to music or raucous times with close friends.<br>
3. <strong>What am I a sicko about?</strong> Probably self-development, and cooking videos. This makes up the majority of my (many) hours spent on youtube.<br>
4. <strong>Am I taking sufficient care of myself?</strong> This prompt got me to finally do a bunch of apartment cleaning which has felt nice now that it&rsquo;s done :)<br>
5. <strong>What would help me feel more internal harmony?</strong> ^ + being a bit more social recently and searching for peers&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/AaaOoyclkE8?si=7e7iuUEqPivK2vYL&t=660">this snippet</a> from Rick Rubin with John Mayer that is forever lodged in my brain that I think is relevant here, where John Mayer talks about imitating Blues legends when he was a kid, vs eventually playing alongside them live:<br>
_<br>
<strong>JM:</strong> <em>&ldquo;Because, it&rsquo;s one thing to play along with a Buddy Guy record from 1972. It&rsquo;s another thing to play in the same moment with the same supply of oxygen as Buddy Guy. You have a point of reference for the moment, the same as he has, so everything he&rsquo;s playing in that moment, that&rsquo;s the university lesson. That&rsquo;s the highest&hellip; that&rsquo;s your doctorate right there. When you hear someone else in that moment playing, and you&rsquo;re grabbing from the same moment, and you hear what they do, that&rsquo;s the best teacher in the world. &hellip; I could give you BB King-ish, I could give you Eric [Clapton]-ish, I could give you Stevie Ray Vaughan-ish.&rdquo;</em><br>
<strong>RR:</strong> <em>&ldquo;But not by duplicating what they did, but playing over the grooves that they&rsquo;re playing over, and understanding the style of what they&rsquo;re doing. More becoming them, instead of copying them.&rdquo;</em><br>
<strong>JM:</strong> <em>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. That&rsquo;s right. Seek what they&rsquo;re seeking, don&rsquo;t seek them.&rdquo;</em>&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
