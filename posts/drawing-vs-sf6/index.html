      <p>Drawing is one of my hobbies.<br>
Drawing gives you the opportunity to snapshot beauty.
Drawing can generate beauty.<br>
Drawing gives you immediate feedback.<br>
Drawing leaves you with an artefact, proof of your efforts.<br>
Drawing is inherently iterative.<br>
Drawing shows you <a target="_blank" href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ErdDoliVkAAGV0A?format=jpg&name=4096x4096">your limits</a>, every session.<br>
Drawing does not necessarily lead to any destination.<br>
Drawing usually includes an &ldquo;<a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/billyisyoung/status/1883992963740832172">ugly phase</a>&rdquo;.<br>
Drawing demands focus.<br>
Drawing demands letting go.<br>
Drawing for more than 1 hour (for me) can be tiring.<br>
Drawing can turn you into a conduit for a spirit greater than yourself.<br>
Drawing can feel like you&rsquo;re always at the base of the mountain, no matter how much you&rsquo;ve already climbed.<br>
Drawing is glorious.</p>
<p>Street Fighter is one of my hobbies.<br>
Street Fighter is a game.<br>
Street Fighter is precise.<br>
Street Fighter is PVP, fighting other people.<br>
Street Fighter is a science.<br>
Street Fighter is an art.<br>
Street Fighter is rock-paper-scissors.<br>
Street Fighter ranked is always putting you at the edge of your ability.<br>
Street Fighter has observability.<br>
Street Fighter has clear progression.<br>
Street Fighter is iterative.<br>
Street Fighter demands focus.<br>
Street Fighter demands letting go.<br>
Street Fighter I can play for 3 hours, easily.
Street Fighter I can do deliberate practice for, easily.
Street Fighter has me popping off at times.<br>
Street Fighter can feel like you&rsquo;re always at the base of the mountain, no matter how much you&rsquo;ve already climbed.<br>
Street Fighter is glorious.</p>
<hr>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about deliberate practice and honing one&rsquo;s craft.</p>
<p>Why do you want to Do The Thing?<br>
How much are you willing to give to the process, before the process even shows a hint of giving you anything back?<br>
How do you survive off the crumbs in between the hits of magic?</p>
<p>How much discipline or belief or drive do you need to stick with something?
Vs how much do you need the process to be enjoyable, so you aren&rsquo;t exhausted after 1 hour, or wanting to bash your head into a wall?</p>
<p>For as much as I&rsquo;ve thought about this, I&rsquo;ve never arrived at a satisfactory answer. There are too many hypotheticals, too many competing desires, too many whims, too many possible trade-offs.</p>
<p>What <em>has</em> brought me closer to answers, has always been <em>action</em>.<br>
Do The Thing, and see how it feels.<br>
Do The Thing, and then decide if you want to do it again the next day or not.<br>
Do The Thing, until you start to grow weary or a new spark ignites somewhere else.<br>
And then decide if you want to stick to Doing The Thing, or do something new.</p>
<p>Street Fighter <em>feels good</em> right now. I&rsquo;m even in the lab, doing deliberate practice and VOD analysis regularly. This almost never happens. So I&rsquo;m going to keep playing. A lot.</p>
<p>Drawing feels alright right now. It feels effortful, heavy, but still rewarding. So I&rsquo;m going to keep at it, and see if I can make it light and fun again.</p>
